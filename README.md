# U.S. Flight Delay Analysis

This project analyzes U.S. domestic flight performance with a focus on delays, cancellations, and on-time arrivals. Using publicly available data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, the analysis explores delay trends, causes, peak delay periods, and airline performance to uncover patterns across the air travel network.

## Motivation
With increasing reports of flight delays and cancellations—especially during peak travel seasons and adverse weather—air travel disruptions have become a common experience. As a traveler who has personally experienced delays and cancellations, this project aims to better understand:

- How often delays occur  
- When delays are most likely  
- What factors contribute most to delays
